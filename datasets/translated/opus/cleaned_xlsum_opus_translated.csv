"Defence Estates, which runs about 2,400 hectares for the MoD, is being replaced by the new Defence Infrastructure Organisation. The MoD said changes would save £1.2bn over the first four years. The Unite union said the decision was ""absolute madness,"" and urged the government to change its mind. Plans to axe 25,000 civilian MoD jobs were outlined in last year's strategic defence review. The department says it will consult with trade unions over the changes, which it says will ""bring together those working on estate and infrastructure activity across the Ministry of Defence"". It says it will bring together 7,000 staff - mostly civilians - working on construction, maintenance and disposal of land and buildings owned by the MoD. Most of them currently work for Defence Estates, although some work in infrastructure jobs in the RAF, Army and Royal Navy or smaller organisations. 'Devastating news' Defence Secretary Liam Fox said having one organisation running the estate would provide ""better strategic management"" and save money in running costs. ""By making these changes we expect to save about 2,500 posts by 2014 and some £1.2 billion over the first four years alone, without reducing the effectiveness or reliability of the service we deliver. ""This measure will make a significant contribution to the civilian staff reductions and efficiency measures set out last October in the Strategic Defence and Security Review."" He said it was the first change stemming from work by the defence reform unit which aims to overhaul the structure of the MoD. Unite national officer Kevin Coyne said: ""This is devastating for our members. It's absolute madness, the Tories spent the 80s decentralising the MoD and now they're centralising it with Stalinist fervour. ""With 2,500 fewer staff, the maintenance and running of MoD properties and land will be run on a shoestring doing our forces and their families a disservice. We urge the government to step back from this decision.""","About 2,500 Ministry of Defence jobs will go within three years, as the department changes the way it manages its land and buildings.","Ang Defence Estates, na tumatakbo ng mga 2,400 ektarya para sa MoD, ay pinapalitan ng bagong Defence Infructment Organisation na ito. Ang MoD ay nagsabi na ang mga pagbabago ay makapagliligtas ng £1.2bn sa mga unang apat na taon. Ang unyong pang-ekonomiya ay nagsabi na ang desisyon ay ""absoluted influsion"" at hinimok ang pamahalaan na baguhin ang isip nito.

"By Danny ShawHome affairs correspondent Joseph McCann, 34, is alleged to have abducted and raped three women in north London and Watford last week. He was not - but should have been - referred to the Parole Board before he was released from prison in February, while halfway through serving a sentence for burglary. The Ministry of Justice said an ""urgent review"" of the case was under way. McCann was jailed in 2008 for aggravated burglary after admitting breaking into the home of an 85-year-old man. He was given an Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection (IPP) with a minimum term, or tariff, of two-and-a-half years. This meant the Parole Board had to decide if it was safe to release him once his tariff expired in 2010. In 2017 he was released on licence, which meant he could be sent back to jail if he reoffended or breached his parole conditions. Later that year, while on licence, McCann was arrested and charged with a further burglary. He was given a three-year jail sentence. McCann's case should have been referred to the board before he was released but in February this year he was dealt with as a ""determinate sentence"" prisoner. This meant he was automatically released 18 months into his sentence. A £20,000 reward has been offered by the Metropolitan Police for information about McCann's whereabouts that leads to his arrest and prosecution. Detectives described McCann as ""extremely dangerous"" and said people should call 999 if they saw him. He is described as white, with a muscular build, a bald head or shaved blond hair, a light-coloured short beard, and the name ""Bobbie"" tattooed on his stomach.

"Everton Nurseries near Lymington, Hampshire displayed a sign urging customers to ""please stock up"" on metaldehyde pellets.

Last year the government announced sales of Metaldehyde, a pesticide used to control slugs in a range of crops and in gardens, are to be banned in June. The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it posed an ""unacceptable risk to birds and mammals"".

The Flower Power Lymo community allotment group in Lymington tweeted: ""Please help STOP this. Encouraging the use of metaldehyde slug pellets is wrong. They're banned for a reason.""

""We are still very interested in that but the challenge around that is the financing and it has to be the right deal for all parties involved and it has to meet everyone's needs.

"The far-right leader, who takes office on 1 January, had questioned the doctors' qualifications. He also accused Cuba's communist government of keeping 75% of their pay, and refusing to let their families join them. The pull-out could disrupt healthcare for millions of Brazilians. Why were so many Cuban doctors in Brazil? Healthcare is Cuba's most lucrative export. The ""More Doctors"" aid programme operates in 67 countries, and makes the island $11bn a year. Around 8,000 Cuban doctors have been working in Brazil's poorest and remotest areas under the scheme. Cuba has said they will all be summoned home by the end of December. However, a Brazilian diplomatic source told AFP that 2,000 will likely stay put due to personal ties. Brazilian mayors have warned that up to 30 million people are facing a care crisis - many in areas where local doctors refuse to go. The first 196 doctors to leave have already been greeted in Havana by Cuba's deputy health minister. Cuban news agency ACN said the medics were ""happy to have fulfilled their mission,"" but ""worried about what awaits the [Brazilian] people with the newly-elected president"".

"Residents of Moseley Green, near Parkend, say the animals regularly ruin grass verges by foraging for food. The Forestry Commission acknowledged there could be more of the animals than a recent survey suggested. A cull by the commission began last month in an attempt to keep numbers down to 400 as part of a three-year management plan. Locals claim estimates of 535 for the boar population was inaccurate and far more than the target of 135 animals need to be killed to reach that figure. Martin Roach, landlord of The Rising Sun pub, said he had spent thousands of pounds making the pub an ""attractive venue"" but the wild boars were causing damage. ""I've got damage all up the driveway,"" he said. ""We all like the countryside, we all like the forest, we all like the boar, but in their place. ""It's got too much. We've got too many of them."" 'Viable population' Resident Clive Skinner said: ""A couple of months ago I was able to repair the damage on a daily basis. ""We're at the stage now that it's major, major work to do the repairs."" Earlier this year the Forestry Commission said a living population of 400 wild boar in the area had been agreed. It said there was an estimated population of 535 animals, meaning 135 would have to be culled before next February. Kevin Stannard from the commission said: ""That figure is a minimum. We still think there are over 700 or 800 animals in the forest. ""If we can bring that level back down to 400 that should be a good compromise for the animal welfare groups to see that we've got a sound, viable population. ""But also for those who visit and use the forest to show we are managing the population and keeping it under control at a level that everyone can live with.""",People living in a hamlet in the Forest of Dean have claimed not enough wild boar are being culled.,"Sinasabi ng mga residente ng Moseley Green, malapit sa Parkend, na ang mga hayop ay regular na sumisira ng mga gilid ng damo sa pamamagitan ng paghahanap ng pagkain.[alam ng Forestry Commission na maaaring magkaroon ng higit sa mga hayop o isang kamakailang surbey na iminungkahi.[kailangan ng sanggunian] Ang isang cull sa pamamagitan ng komisyon ay nagsimula noong nakaraang buwan sa pagtatangkang panatilihin ang mga numero hanggang 400 bilang bahagi ng tatlong-taon na plano sa pangangasiwa.

"Sergio Cabral served two terms as Rio state governor from 2007 to 2014. He was accused of received kickbacks from construction firms in return for awarding them lucrative contracts, such as a petrochemical plant in Rio. Judge Sergio Moro said there was not enough evidence to convict Cabral's wife Adriana Ancelmo. Cabral was detained in November as part of Operation Car Wash, a huge corruption investigation which has resulted in the arrest of a long list of high-ranking politicians and influential business people in Brazil. Cabral is a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party of President Michel Temer, who is also under investigation for alleged corruption. Judge Moro said the former governor had taken 2.7m reais ($813,000; £638,000) in bribes. The judge said the money had not yet been found and that he suspected Cabral had transferred it before his accounts were blocked.

"By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor The data measures the percentage of working-age adults who are employed. In the period March to May 2019, the rate increased by 1.7 percentage points compared to the same period in 2018. During the recession, the employment rate reached a low of 64%. Despite the latest increase, Northern Ireland's employment rate is still below the average UK rate of 76%. Economic inactivity in Northern Ireland also decreased over the quarter and the year to one of the lowest rates on record - 25.9%. It is a measurement of those people who are not in work and not looking for work - that includes students, retired people and sick or disabled people. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) said the falling inactivity rate since 2017 suggests that some people have been re-entering the labour market. ""Decreases in economic inactivity since late 2017 indicate that changes in labour market status have not been limited to those working or looking for work, but also for those who were previously outside the labour force,"" its statement said. Meanwhile wage growth in the UK rose to 3.6% in the year to May 2019, the highest growth rate since 2008, according to Office for National Statistics figures.

"David CornockParliamentary correspondent, Wales The number of Welsh MPs will fall from 40 to 29 at the next general election as part of a move to reduce the number of MPs across the UK from 650 to 600. The changes are being made as a result of rules that require broadly equal numbers of voters in each constituency. Welsh constituencies currently have, on average, fewer voters than English ones. Changes that would have cut the number of Welsh MPs from 40 to 30 were blocked by the Liberal Democrats during the coalition government after an outcry from Labour MPs. Stand by for a repeat of that row. Today's revised proposals are based on new figures on the electoral register. The average number of voters in each constituency, according to the Office for National Statistics, is 54,300 in Wales, 66,700 in Scotland, 68,200 in Northern Ireland and 70,100 in England. The Boundary Commission for Wales said it would publish ""initial proposals"" for Welsh constituencies later this year, to be followed by a period of consultation. The new map will be drawn with the goal of ensuring each seat has between 71,031 and 78,507 electors. The average size of the electorate per constituency across the UK is 74,769, with the electorate of each constituency having to be within 5% of that - meaning each must have between 71,031 and 78,507 voters.

"Eight organisations have called for action following reports of elephant meat being sold openly in markets. Armed rebels seized power and ousted President Francois Bozize in March after a peace deal collapsed. Wildlife park staff say the security situation is preventing them from searching forests for animal carcasses. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said its offices in the protected Dzanga-Sangha area had been looted three times in the past month and it had pulled out workers. 'Fearing the worst' The UNESCO World Heritage Site has been home to an estimated 3,400 forest elephants, which are smaller than those on the African savannahs. But a recent study, lead by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), showed forest elephant numbers had decreased by 62% across Central Africa over the last 10 years. The WCS met with seven other groups, including the WWF and the African Parks Network, on Friday to propose ways for governments to tackle the problem. They said penalties should be increased and better links built with consumer countries such as China and Thailand. It is not known how many elephants have died in the recent spate of killings, which are believed to be part of a wider surge in poaching fuelled by growing Asian demand for ivory. ""Elephant poaching is on the increase and given the fact that Central African Republic for the moment is also in dire straits we are fearing for the worst in terms of people trying to look seriously for ivory,"" said Bas Huijbregts, head of policy for WWF's campaign against poaching in Central Africa. ""Given the total absence of any type of law enforcement and rule of law in the area, there is elephant meat all over the place,"" he told the Associated Press. Representatives from the region's governments are understood to meeting next week to discuss the proposals.","Poachers are taking advantage of instability in the Central African Republic (CAR) to kill more endangered elephants, wildlife campaigners say.","Walong organisasyon ang nagsabi na ang kaayusang ito ay may kaugnayan sa mga batas ng rehiyon ng elepante na hayagang ipinagbibili sa mga pamilihan.

"Helen Bailey was found with her throat cut in August 1975. The eight-year-old disappeared while wearing blue clothes and was dubbed ""Little Girl Blue"". An inquest in 1976 heard she may have died as a result of an ""accident or practical joke gone wrong"" and jurors returned an open verdict. But judges quashed it, citing evidence from 2014 she had been strangled. Sitting with Mrs Justice Whipple in London, Lord Justice Hickinbottom said: ""In my view, the emergence of this new evidence may well lead to the conclusion that the truth of how Helen met her death was not revealed at the first inquest.

For news and updates from the West Midlands The court heard Helen left her home in the Perry Barr area of Birmingham to play at about 15:30 BST on 10 August. Her mother alerted police when she did not return home and her body was found in woodland the next day. A post-mortem examination at the time identified a cut to her throat as the cause of death. The pathologist found there were no signs of a struggle and the circumstances ""lacked the essential hallmarks of a homicidal attack"". However, the investigation into her death was reopened in 2014, with a pathologist concluding Helen had been strangled before her throat was cut in a ""clear case of homicide"". Lord Justice Hickinbottom said this was consistent with a ""confession"" by one suspect which was investigated by West Midlands Police, but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute him.

Sandie Conway from the cathedral said most of the existing gargoyles were headless, due to intentional damage during the English Civil War.

"The surgery is part of a European trial to find another form of treatment for people with the ailment. The trial, which involves 96 patients, involves electrically stimulating one of the nerves leading to the heart. It is hoped the procedure could shrink the heart and improve life expectancy. The NHS says more than a million adults in the UK suffer from heart failure. John Joiner, from Weston-super-Mare, is the first British patient to undergo the procedure, which sees surgeons fit a device - similar to a pacemaker - to the vagus nerve which runs to the heart. 'Noticed improvement' For the first six months of the trial, two out of three patients have the vagal nerve stimulator turned on. After six months all participants will have it switched on. Mr Joiner said he did not know whether his device had been activated yet but suspects that it has. ""I've certainly in the last couple of weeks noticed an improvement in my breathlessness, not a lot but it's something,"" he said. ""I can climb stairs more easily and the duration of my walking seems to be getting a little better, I can now walk up to three miles."" The Bristol Heart Institute (BHI) was the first site in the UK and the third in the world to implant the device. Dr Angus Nightingale, from the BRI, said: ""Stimulating the vagus nerve is commonly used to treat epilepsy and depression but may have other significant benefits. ""The device goes under the skin in the chest and is then attached to the vagus nerve in the neck under general anaesthetic."" He said the device stimulated the nerve when switched on. ""The idea behind this is that chronic autonomic imbalance is believed to be a risk factor of the progression of heart failure and adverse cardiovascular events,"" he added. ""The stimulation should alter the balance of the system and improve cardiac function."" The trial will evaluate 96 patients at 25 sites across Europe.",Doctors in Bristol are the first in the UK to successfully implant a nerve-stimulating device in two patients in an effort to treat people with heart failure.,"Ang operasyon ay bahagi ng European trial upang ma-record ang isa pang anyo ng paggamot para sa mga taong may karamdaman.

The 99-year-old park, which is based in Kettering, Northamptonshire, is owned by the Wicksteed Charitable Trust. Trust chairman Oliver Wicksteed said the support was ""truly outstanding"". The cash will mean the park can continue to be free to enter and go towards staffing, security and bills, as well as looking after the animals and grounds. The move to administration led to the loss of 48 permanent staff and 67 part-time and other jobs. The trust backed the formation of a new smaller company, with the aim of raising money to re-open the park. So far, well-wishers have raised £123,000 from donations and sponsored activities. Mr Wicksteed said: ""The response from local people has been truly outstanding and we can't thank them enough for what they have done and what they continue to do."" Running the park alone, without the rides, costs about £110,000 a month. The coronavirus outbreak left the trust with no income for months, apart from a small contribution from car parking.

Jurors heard the couple had previously called Keigan derogatory names in messages to each other. Ms O'Brien began the relationship with Mr Currie, despite warnings not to go out with him, six months before Keigan's death, the court heard.

Ms O'Brien explained to the friend she did not take him to hospital because ""they will start asking questions"".

"Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the hymen examinations were ""harmful and humiliating'. Another group said they may amount to torture. The Indonesian military has defended the tests, saying they stop immoral women from entering the armed forces. Indonesia's police faced criticism last year for requiring the examinations. As well as HRW, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT) also spoke out about the practice ahead of a conference on military medicine in Bali, Indonesia. IRCT described the testing as ""a gross violation of women's rights and one that may amount to ill-treatment and torture under international law"". Both organisations also claimed that the fiancees of male officers were required to be examined before the marriage could go ahead, though the armed forces told AFP that this was not the case. 'Bad habit' A spokesman for Indonesia's military, Fuad Basya, told the BBC the test was ""still relevant"". He said he understood why some non-virgins should seek to join the military, adding: ""It may be because of an accident, disease or because of a habit"" - meaning sexual intercourse. ""If it is their habit, the Indonesian military cannot accept potential recruits like these,"" Mr Basya said. The World Health Organization regards virginity tests as a form of sexual violence. It also says the practice has no scientific validity. There are many reasons why a woman's hymen (a membrane which partially covers the vaginal opening) may not appear ""intact"" on examination. After widespread condemnation in 2014 of the Indonesian police force's use of the practice for recruits, the government said it would no longer require women enrolling at a college for civil servants to undergo the examination. A local plan to require schoolgirls in part of Java to undergo the so-called virginity tests before they could gain a secondary school diploma was scrapped after an outcry earlier this year.",Human rights activists have urged Indonesia to stop requiring female military recruits to undergo so-called virginity testing.,"Ang Human Rights Watch (HRW) ay nagsabi na ang hymen examination ay ""harmful and elastic'.

At Tesco's annual meeting on Friday, 47% of shareholders either voted against its boardroom pay policy or abstained. Marks and Spencer holds its annual shareholder meeting next week and could face a similar backlash.

"Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where 200 more are needed, is asking existing staff to work extra shifts. The Royal College of Nursing said it would be dangerous for the health of staff and patients if up to three extra shifts had to be worked per week. The hospital said its campaign targeted experienced and newly qualified staff for all departments. A hospital spokeswoman said: ""Cambridge University Hospitals has launched a national recruitment campaign for nurses, midwives and healthcare assistants. ""We are looking for staff across all clinical divisions and are finding creative ways of encouraging experienced nurses to consider Addenbrooke's as an opportunity to develop their career ""We are instigating a European recruitment programme."" English to be tested As well as extra shift payments existing staff are said to have been offered shopping vouchers to persuade them to work longer hours. Karen Webb from the Royal College of Nursing said: ""I was not aware that we were entering an age of bartering to get employees to work. ""It is important that nurses, as professional people, are rewarded appropriately and adequately for their services to the NHS."" Steve Hand, director of operations at Addenbrooke's, said that the hospital needed about 200 extra staff to meet commitments to patients. The hospital was looking for experienced nurses and had turned to Europe to seek them out, he said. ""We will carry out English tests but I do not think language is going to be an issue,"" he said. Former NHS Trust chairman Roy Lilley said that many hospitals were setting up staff banks which were lists of people willing to do extra shifts. Many experienced nurses in their 50s and 60s had taken early retirement because of the pressures in the NHS, he said. There had also been about 1,000 job cuts in Cambridgeshire and this all added to the problem, he added.","A hospital in Cambridge is to recruit nurses, midwives and other staff from across Europe to meet ward shortages.","Sinabi ng The Royal College of Nursing na ang N&M's Hospital sa Cambridge, kung saan 200 pa ang kinakailangan, ay humihiling sa umiiral na mga kawani na gumawa ng karagdagang mga pagbabago.

"The cause of death of Byun Hee-soo, a transgender rights campaigner, is not yet known. She launched a landmark legal challenge against the military in January last year over her dismissal. Her petition for reinstatement was rejected in July. South Korea remains conservative on matters relating to the LGBT community. The 23-year-old had been receiving counselling from a mental health centre near her home in Cheongju in Chungcheong province (which is south of Seoul). Her counsellor became concerned after not hearing from her since 28 February and called emergency services. Ms Byun's case triggered debate about the treatment of transgender troops and soldiers from the LGBTQ community in the country. She previously told reporters that apart from her gender identity, she wanted to show everyone that she could also be one of the great soldiers who protect the country. All able-bodied South Korean men are required to carry out military service for nearly two years. In December, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea said the decision not to allow her to continue to serve in the military had no legal grounds. South Korea is far less tolerant of the LGBTQ community than its East Asian neighbours. Being LGBT is often seen as a disability or a mental illness, or by powerful conservative churches as a sin, and there are no anti-discrimination laws in the country. In Ms Byun's case, anti-LGBT campaigners had attempted to identify her online. They also held demonstrations urging the military to dismiss her after news about the case emerged and have called for further demonstrations.","South Korea's first transgender soldier, who was discharged from the military for undergoing gender reassignment surgery, has been found dead at her home.","Ang sanhi ng kamatayan ni Byun Hee-soo, isang transgender na tagapangampanya ng mga karapatan sa Asya, ay hindi pa alam.

"It predicted that prices would have to rise 1% between 2016 and 2020. That is on top of an increase of 5% it expects to have to make as a result of general wage inflation. The Living Wage means that the minimum wage will be set at £7.20 an hour for over-25s from April 2016, which is forecast to rise to £9.35 in 2020. The prediction came with Next's half year results - pre-tax profits came in at £347m, up 7% from the same period of 2014. Earlier in the year, the company's shares fell after it issued a cautious sales outlook, predicting they would grow between 1.5% and 5.5%. In the first half, total Next group sales were up 2.7% compared with the same period of 2014. Budget changes On Wednesday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) published some research into how far the National Living Wage (NLW) would offset the cuts in benefits and tax credits announced in the 2015 Budget. It found that families with someone in paid employment that are eligible for benefits or tax credits would lose an average of £750 a year as a result of the changes. The IFS estimates that this group of 8.4 million working-age households will gain an average of £200 a year from the NLW. It says this is an optimistic estimate because it assumes that the NLW will have no effect on GDP, employment or the number of hours worked. Those averages also mask the differences in effects on different income groups. The IFS estimated that households in lower income groups would lose more as a result of the tax credit and benefit changes but gain less as a result of the NLW.",The retailer Next has set out the effect it thinks the government's National Living Wage will have on its prices.,"Ito ay humula na ang mga presyo ay magreresulta sa pagtaas ng 1% sa pagitan ng 2016 at 2020.

The overstatement was roughly triple an initial Toshiba estimate. The finance minister, Taro Aso, said the case could undermine confidence in corporate governance in Japan.

"The viruses were found on office computers and in a system used to model the movement of nuclear fuel rods. Power firm RWE said the infection posed no threat to the plant because its control systems were not linked to the internet, so the viruses could not activate. German federal cyber investigators are now analysing how the Gundremmingen plant became infected. No damage The viruses were found on the fuel rod modelling system and on 18 USB sticks used as removable data stores on office computers. Staff found the viruses as they prepared to upgrade the computerised control systems for the plant's Block B, which is currently not producing power while it undergoes scheduled maintenance. More than 1,000 computers have now been checked for infection and cleaned up, an RWE spokesman told newspaper Die Zeit. The plant has also improved its security controls. No system directly involved with the control of the nuclear reactors was infected, RWE said, and there was no danger to the public as a result of the infection. ""All sensitive plant areas are decoupled and designed with redundancy and protected against manipulation,"" added RWE in a statement. Among the viruses were two well-known malicious programs - W32.Ramnit and Conficker. Ramnit debuted in 2010 and is a remote access tool that its creators use to steal data. Conficker dates from 2008 and aims to grab login names and financial data. Because the infected systems were isolated from the net, neither Ramnit nor Conficker were able to activate, update and steal data, said RWE. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, said power plants and other chunks of a nation's critical infrastructure were often infected by viruses but such compromises did little damage. ""The most common viruses spread without much awareness of where they are,"" he told Reuters. Gundremmingen is about 120km (75m) northwest of Munich and the plant is Gemany's highest output power station.",Computer viruses have infected PCs used at a German nuclear power plant.,"Ang mga virus ay natagpuan sa mga computer sa opisina at sa isang sistema na ginagamit upang i-modelo ang paggalaw ng nuclear fuel rods.

Leicestershire Police said the murderer ""fabricated a story that he had been out to the shops and returned to find his friend dead"". But CCTV footage, forensic evidence and witness statements ""revealed Green's web of lies"" and led the force to charge him with murder. Det Insp Kenny Henry said: ""The sheer level of violence used in this crime was shocking."" Green was sentenced to life imprisonment, and will not be eligible for parole for 21 years and 10 months.

"The world's biggest memory chip maker forecast operating earnings of 15.1 trillion won ($14.1bn; £10.4bn) - up 64% from a year earlier. But while chip prices boosted margins, a stronger won weighed on the figures. The record guidance comes despite a corruption scandal engulfing top leadership at the South Korean firm. The operating profit forecast is slightly below the 15.9 trillion won estimated by analysts surveyed by Reuters. Customers unfazed The forecast keeps Samsung on track for record annual profits, in a year when prices for computer memory chips kept surging. But the 2018 outlook is less certain, with Samsung shares having fallen nearly 10% from their all-time high in November, as some investors bet on an end to the chip boom. Meanwhile, the market for smartphones and other mobile devices is facing increasing competition from Chinese rivals. As well as the jailing of its heir apparent Lee Jae-yong for bribery and corruption, Samsung's reputation was also hurt by the global recall of its flagship Note 7 smartphone in 2016, following the fiasco with its overheating and exploding batteries. However the problems with the handset did not cause major disruption to the firm's finances, helped by its buoyant chip business as well as customers seeming unfazed by the incident. Samsung Electronics is regarded as the jewel in the crown of the Samsung Group conglomerate, which is made up of 60 interlinked companies and is one of South Korea's massive family-run businesses known as chaebols.","Samsung Electronics expects to deliver record profits for the last three months of 2017, but the estimate missed analyst expectations.","Ang pinakamalaking tagagawa ng memory chip sa buong mundo ay humula ng mga kita ng 15.1 trilyon na napanalunan ($14.1bn; £10.4bn) - up 64% mula sa isang taon na mas maaga. ngunit habang ang mga presyo ng chip ay nag-ebolb ng mga mardyin, ang isang mas malakas na napanalunan sa mga numero.

"A convoy of trucks escorted by police carried the remains from the airport to the presidential palace in Lima. Yale agreed to return the artefacts last year after a long campaign by Peru. President Alan Garcia led the welcoming ceremony. ""They are treasures, even though they are not made of gold or precious stones, because they represent the dignity and pride of Peru,"" Mr Garcia said before there was a gun salute for the artefacts. Centenary The relics will be briefly displayed in Lima before being taken to Cuzco - the historical capital of the Inca empire - where they will housed in a new cultural centre. The return comes just in time for the centenary of the ""discovery"" of Machu Picchu by the American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1912. Peru waged a long diplomatic and legal campaign to recover the artefacts, which it said had only been loaned to Yale. In all some 45,000 archaeological pieces are to be returned.

It is the most famous monument of the Inca empire, which ruled until the 15th Century Spanish conquest.","Peru has given a lavish welcome to hundreds of Inca artefacts returned by Yale University in the US, nearly a century after they were taken from the famed citadel of Machu Picchu.","Isang kumpanya ng mga trak na sinamahan ng pulisya ang nagdala ng mga labí mula sa paliparan tungo sa palasyo ng presidente sa Lima.Si Yale ay sumang - ayon na ibalik ang mga gawa ng sining noong nakaraang taon pagkatapos ng isang mahabang kampanya ng Peru.
