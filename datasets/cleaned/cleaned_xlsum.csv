"Defence Estates, which runs about 2,400 hectares for the MoD, is being replaced by the new Defence Infrastructure Organisation. The MoD said changes would save £1.2bn over the first four years. The Unite union said the decision was ""absolute madness,"" and urged the government to change its mind. Plans to axe 25,000 civilian MoD jobs were outlined in last year's strategic defence review. The department says it will consult with trade unions over the changes, which it says will ""bring together those working on estate and infrastructure activity across the Ministry of Defence"". It says it will bring together 7,000 staff - mostly civilians - working on construction, maintenance and disposal of land and buildings owned by the MoD. Most of them currently work for Defence Estates, although some work in infrastructure jobs in the RAF, Army and Royal Navy or smaller organisations. 'Devastating news' Defence Secretary Liam Fox said having one organisation running the estate would provide ""better strategic management"" and save money in running costs. ""By making these changes we expect to save about 2,500 posts by 2014 and some £1.2 billion over the first four years alone, without reducing the effectiveness or reliability of the service we deliver. ""This measure will make a significant contribution to the civilian staff reductions and efficiency measures set out last October in the Strategic Defence and Security Review."" He said it was the first change stemming from work by the defence reform unit which aims to overhaul the structure of the MoD. Unite national officer Kevin Coyne said: ""This is devastating for our members. It's absolute madness, the Tories spent the 80s decentralising the MoD and now they're centralising it with Stalinist fervour. ""With 2,500 fewer staff, the maintenance and running of MoD properties and land will be run on a shoestring doing our forces and their families a disservice. We urge the government to step back from this decision.""","About 2,500 Ministry of Defence jobs will go within three years, as the department changes the way it manages its land and buildings."
"By Danny ShawHome affairs correspondent Joseph McCann, 34, is alleged to have abducted and raped three women in north London and Watford last week. He was not - but should have been - referred to the Parole Board before he was released from prison in February, while halfway through serving a sentence for burglary. The Ministry of Justice said an ""urgent review"" of the case was under way. McCann was jailed in 2008 for aggravated burglary after admitting breaking into the home of an 85-year-old man. He was given an Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection (IPP) with a minimum term, or tariff, of two-and-a-half years. This meant the Parole Board had to decide if it was safe to release him once his tariff expired in 2010. In 2017 he was released on licence, which meant he could be sent back to jail if he reoffended or breached his parole conditions. Later that year, while on licence, McCann was arrested and charged with a further burglary. He was given a three-year jail sentence. McCann's case should have been referred to the board before he was released but in February this year he was dealt with as a ""determinate sentence"" prisoner. This meant he was automatically released 18 months into his sentence. A £20,000 reward has been offered by the Metropolitan Police for information about McCann's whereabouts that leads to his arrest and prosecution. Detectives described McCann as ""extremely dangerous"" and said people should call 999 if they saw him. He is described as white, with a muscular build, a bald head or shaved blond hair, a light-coloured short beard, and the name ""Bobbie"" tattooed on his stomach.

This might seem like an unusual personal ad, but one lonely goose in Moira is apparently heartbroken after her companion tragically died. Now an appeal has been made to find her a new man - or gander to be precise. Barbara Mladek is the founder of Northern Ireland Battery Hen Rescue and is trying to find a ""more mature"" gander. ""A friend of mine had a pair of geese for a long number of years. ""Unfortunately the gander died on Thursday night and the 21-year-old goose is really distressed pining for her mate,"" she said. Ms Mladek explained that geese mate for life, but if one dies, they can match again if another goose comes along quickly enough. ""As soon as you introduce them one-on-one, the gander immediately protects the goose, they share a bucket of water, and do a head dipping ritual that says 'yeah, you're mine now.' ""It's a lovely thing to watch."" She set up Northern Ireland Battery Hen Rescue six years ago and is optimistic she will find a match for the goose. ""I've found a gander before for someone who was looking for a mate for her goose. ""There are a lot of people in Northern Ireland who do have a flock of geese; maybe they have too many ganders, or maybe an older gander has lost his mate.""

"Everton Nurseries near Lymington, Hampshire displayed a sign urging customers to ""please stock up"" on metaldehyde pellets. Friends of the Earth said it was ""irresponsible"" to encourage use of the chemical which is to be banned over concerns about its effects on wildlife. The store later apologised, saying it was ""completely wrong"". Last year the government announced sales of Metaldehyde, a pesticide used to control slugs in a range of crops and in gardens, are to be banned in June. The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it posed an ""unacceptable risk to birds and mammals"". The garden centre placed a sign alongside its stock of metaldehyde slug pellets saying: ""Sadly, the most effective slug killer, metaldehyde, will no longer be available for sale"", before encouraging customers to stock up and use the product during the period of 12 months when its use remains legal. New Forest Friends of the Earth tweeted a picture of the sign which it described as ""outrageous"". It said the chemical was ""responsible for deaths right up the food chain - hedgehogs and birds for example"". The Flower Power Lymo community allotment group in Lymington tweeted: ""Please help STOP this. Encouraging the use of metaldehyde slug pellets is wrong. They're banned for a reason."" In a statement, Everton Nurseries director Simon Collyer said it was an ""ill-advised attempt to promote sales"" by a junior member of staff. ""We agree that it was completely wrong to promote the sale of product shortly to be made illegal. ""All units of the product and associated signage have been removed from the shelves and Everton Nurseries will no longer offer it for sale,"" he added.",A garden centre has been criticised for promoting soon-to-be-banned slug pellets.
"Visitors have complained about hour-long waits outside at Leicester Royal Infirmary leading to missed appointments. Officials have admitted there are serious problems at peak times. Both the hospital and city council insisted they were looking at solutions including new car parks but funding issues remained. One way Officials admitted the 400-space Havelock Street car park could not cope with demand, especially since a nearby private car park had temporarily closed. Nigel Bond, head of facilities at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, said land near the Leicester Tigers' stadium had planning permission for a multi-storey car park. ""We are still very interested in that but the challenge around that is the financing and it has to be the right deal for all parties involved and it has to meet everyone's needs. ""We are also consulting with private car park providers and we are developing the building strategy for the royal infirmary site and we are very conscious for the need for public parking on the site."" Patrick Kitterick, chairman of the planning committee at Leicester City Council, admitted that until a new car park was built, they were ""tinkering at the edges"". ""There is a lot of conflict when Jarrom Street meets Havelock Street. So we are looking at playing about with a one-way system there. ""But it is not going to solve the big problem which is the car park is heavily used at specific times and the access and exits to it are very difficult.""",Bosses at a Leicester hospital have said they are looking at solutions to long parking queues.
"The far-right leader, who takes office on 1 January, had questioned the doctors' qualifications. He also accused Cuba's communist government of keeping 75% of their pay, and refusing to let their families join them. The pull-out could disrupt healthcare for millions of Brazilians. Why were so many Cuban doctors in Brazil? Healthcare is Cuba's most lucrative export. The ""More Doctors"" aid programme operates in 67 countries, and makes the island $11bn a year. Around 8,000 Cuban doctors have been working in Brazil's poorest and remotest areas under the scheme. Cuba has said they will all be summoned home by the end of December. However, a Brazilian diplomatic source told AFP that 2,000 will likely stay put due to personal ties. Brazilian mayors have warned that up to 30 million people are facing a care crisis - many in areas where local doctors refuse to go. The first 196 doctors to leave have already been greeted in Havana by Cuba's deputy health minister. Cuban news agency ACN said the medics were ""happy to have fulfilled their mission,"" but ""worried about what awaits the [Brazilian] people with the newly-elected president"".

"Residents of Moseley Green, near Parkend, say the animals regularly ruin grass verges by foraging for food. The Forestry Commission acknowledged there could be more of the animals than a recent survey suggested. A cull by the commission began last month in an attempt to keep numbers down to 400 as part of a three-year management plan. Locals claim estimates of 535 for the boar population was inaccurate and far more than the target of 135 animals need to be killed to reach that figure. Martin Roach, landlord of The Rising Sun pub, said he had spent thousands of pounds making the pub an ""attractive venue"" but the wild boars were causing damage. ""I've got damage all up the driveway,"" he said. ""We all like the countryside, we all like the forest, we all like the boar, but in their place. ""It's got too much. We've got too many of them."" 'Viable population' Resident Clive Skinner said: ""A couple of months ago I was able to repair the damage on a daily basis. ""We're at the stage now that it's major, major work to do the repairs."" Earlier this year the Forestry Commission said a living population of 400 wild boar in the area had been agreed. It said there was an estimated population of 535 animals, meaning 135 would have to be culled before next February. Kevin Stannard from the commission said: ""That figure is a minimum. We still think there are over 700 or 800 animals in the forest. ""If we can bring that level back down to 400 that should be a good compromise for the animal welfare groups to see that we've got a sound, viable population. ""But also for those who visit and use the forest to show we are managing the population and keeping it under control at a level that everyone can live with.""",People living in a hamlet in the Forest of Dean have claimed not enough wild boar are being culled.
"Sergio Cabral served two terms as Rio state governor from 2007 to 2014. He was accused of received kickbacks from construction firms in return for awarding them lucrative contracts, such as a petrochemical plant in Rio. Judge Sergio Moro said there was not enough evidence to convict Cabral's wife Adriana Ancelmo. Cabral was detained in November as part of Operation Car Wash, a huge corruption investigation which has resulted in the arrest of a long list of high-ranking politicians and influential business people in Brazil. Cabral is a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party of President Michel Temer, who is also under investigation for alleged corruption. Judge Moro said the former governor had taken 2.7m reais ($813,000; £638,000) in bribes.

"By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor The data measures the percentage of working-age adults who are employed. In the period March to May 2019, the rate increased by 1.7 percentage points compared to the same period in 2018. During the recession, the employment rate reached a low of 64%.

Economic inactivity in Northern Ireland also decreased over the quarter and the year to one of the lowest rates on record - 25.9%. It is a measurement of those people who are not in work and not looking for work - that includes students, retired people and sick or disabled people. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) said the falling inactivity rate since 2017 suggests that some people have been re-entering the labour market.

""Being mainly self funding we have to earn almost everything we need to run, so any downturn in people visiting has a significant impact,"" he said.

"David CornockParliamentary correspondent, Wales The number of Welsh MPs will fall from 40 to 29 at the next general election as part of a move to reduce the number of MPs across the UK from 650 to 600. The changes are being made as a result of rules that require broadly equal numbers of voters in each constituency. Welsh constituencies currently have, on average, fewer voters than English ones. Changes that would have cut the number of Welsh MPs from 40 to 30 were blocked by the Liberal Democrats during the coalition government after an outcry from Labour MPs. Stand by for a repeat of that row. Today's revised proposals are based on new figures on the electoral register. The average number of voters in each constituency, according to the Office for National Statistics, is 54,300 in Wales, 66,700 in Scotland, 68,200 in Northern Ireland and 70,100 in England. The Boundary Commission for Wales said it would publish ""initial proposals"" for Welsh constituencies later this year, to be followed by a period of consultation. The new map will be drawn with the goal of ensuring each seat has between 71,031 and 78,507 electors. The average size of the electorate per constituency across the UK is 74,769, with the electorate of each constituency having to be within 5% of that - meaning each must have between 71,031 and 78,507 voters.

"Eight organisations have called for action following reports of elephant meat being sold openly in markets. Armed rebels seized power and ousted President Francois Bozize in March after a peace deal collapsed. Wildlife park staff say the security situation is preventing them from searching forests for animal carcasses. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said its offices in the protected Dzanga-Sangha area had been looted three times in the past month and it had pulled out workers. 'Fearing the worst' The UNESCO World Heritage Site has been home to an estimated 3,400 forest elephants, which are smaller than those on the African savannahs. But a recent study, lead by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), showed forest elephant numbers had decreased by 62% across Central Africa over the last 10 years. The WCS met with seven other groups, including the WWF and the African Parks Network, on Friday to propose ways for governments to tackle the problem. They said penalties should be increased and better links built with consumer countries such as China and Thailand. It is not known how many elephants have died in the recent spate of killings, which are believed to be part of a wider surge in poaching fuelled by growing Asian demand for ivory. ""Elephant poaching is on the increase and given the fact that Central African Republic for the moment is also in dire straits we are fearing for the worst in terms of people trying to look seriously for ivory,"" said Bas Huijbregts, head of policy for WWF's campaign against poaching in Central Africa. ""Given the total absence of any type of law enforcement and rule of law in the area, there is elephant meat all over the place,"" he told the Associated Press. Representatives from the region's governments are understood to meeting next week to discuss the proposals.","Poachers are taking advantage of instability in the Central African Republic (CAR) to kill more endangered elephants, wildlife campaigners say."

"Helen Bailey was found with her throat cut in August 1975. The eight-year-old disappeared while wearing blue clothes and was dubbed ""Little Girl Blue"". An inquest in 1976 heard she may have died as a result of an ""accident or practical joke gone wrong"" and jurors returned an open verdict. But judges quashed it, citing evidence from 2014 she had been strangled. Sitting with Mrs Justice Whipple in London, Lord Justice Hickinbottom said: ""In my view, the emergence of this new evidence may well lead to the conclusion that the truth of how Helen met her death was not revealed at the first inquest. ""I am persuaded that the interests of justice do make a further inquest desirable."" For news and updates from the West Midlands The court heard Helen left her home in the Perry Barr area of Birmingham to play at about 15:30 BST on 10 August. Her mother alerted police when she did not return home and her body was found in woodland the next day. A post-mortem examination at the time identified a cut to her throat as the cause of death. The pathologist found there were no signs of a struggle and the circumstances ""lacked the essential hallmarks of a homicidal attack"". However, the investigation into her death was reopened in 2014, with a pathologist concluding Helen had been strangled before her throat was cut in a ""clear case of homicide"". Lord Justice Hickinbottom said this was consistent with a ""confession"" by one suspect which was investigated by West Midlands Police, but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute him. The force asked Birmingham and Solihull senior coroner Louise Hunt to seek permission to overturn the original inquest verdict.

"The play, written by Doctor Foster writer Mike Bartlett, is being adapted into a one-off drama for BBC Two. The Olivier Award-winning play imagines Prince Charles's accession to the throne following the Queen's death. Tim Pigott-Smith, who played King Charles on stage, is reprising the role for TV. Charlotte Riley, who has also appeared in the mini-series Close to the Enemy and the film London Has Fallen, said she was ""really excited"" to take on the ""challenge"" of playing Kate Middleton. She said: ""It's such a unique project. To be both modern and rich in verse and to play someone who is real but yet totally re-imagined for this story is an exciting prospect for an actor. ""Kate Middleton is a really interesting woman, particularly within the context of this play, and it is a challenge I am really looking forward to."" Constitutional crisis In the play, King Charles refuses to sign a controversial bill into law, leading to political chaos, a constitutional crisis and rioting in the streets.

"The maiden, the young man and the mother and baby salamander join 10 others all designed by the cathedral's master mason and inspired by psalm 148. ""Carving gargoyles is a rare opportunity for us to express ourselves creatively,"" said Pascal Mychalysin. ""I am sure our medieval counterparts didn't go to art school, so we are carrying on that tradition."" Gargoyles are used to discharge water from the roof and away from the side of a building. 'Target practice' The combination of cold and wet conditions can cause severe damage to the building fabric as has happened in the past to the north transept of Gloucester Cathedral, where the whole facade had to be replaced. Gloucester Cathedral still has some Gothic gargoyles carved at the end of the 12th Century. Sandie Conway from the cathedral said most of the existing gargoyles were headless, due to intentional damage during the English Civil War. She said: ""There is evidence that the gargoyles were used for target practice by the Puritan soldiers and the stonework on the south aisle shows impact holes from musket balls.""",Three new gargoyles have been lifted into position in the south aisle of Gloucester Cathedral.
"The surgery is part of a European trial to find another form of treatment for people with the ailment. The trial, which involves 96 patients, involves electrically stimulating one of the nerves leading to the heart. It is hoped the procedure could shrink the heart and improve life expectancy. The NHS says more than a million adults in the UK suffer from heart failure. John Joiner, from Weston-super-Mare, is the first British patient to undergo the procedure, which sees surgeons fit a device - similar to a pacemaker - to the vagus nerve which runs to the heart. 'Noticed improvement' For the first six months of the trial, two out of three patients have the vagal nerve stimulator turned on. After six months all participants will have it switched on. Mr Joiner said he did not know whether his device had been activated yet but suspects that it has. ""I've certainly in the last couple of weeks noticed an improvement in my breathlessness, not a lot but it's something,"" he said. ""I can climb stairs more easily and the duration of my walking seems to be getting a little better, I can now walk up to three miles."" The Bristol Heart Institute (BHI) was the first site in the UK and the third in the world to implant the device. Dr Angus Nightingale, from the BRI, said: ""Stimulating the vagus nerve is commonly used to treat epilepsy and depression but may have other significant benefits. ""The device goes under the skin in the chest and is then attached to the vagus nerve in the neck under general anaesthetic."" He said the device stimulated the nerve when switched on. ""The idea behind this is that chronic autonomic imbalance is believed to be a risk factor of the progression of heart failure and adverse cardiovascular events,"" he added. ""The stimulation should alter the balance of the system and improve cardiac function."" The trial will evaluate 96 patients at 25 sites across Europe.",Doctors in Bristol are the first in the UK to successfully implant a nerve-stimulating device in two patients in an effort to treat people with heart failure.

The cash will mean the park can continue to be free to enter and go towards staffing, security and bills, as well as looking after the animals and grounds. The move to administration led to the loss of 48 permanent staff and 67 part-time and other jobs. The trust backed the formation of a new smaller company, with the aim of raising money to re-open the park. So far, well-wishers have raised £123,000 from donations and sponsored activities. Mr Wicksteed said: ""The response from local people has been truly outstanding and we can't thank them enough for what they have done and what they continue to do.""

"Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the hymen examinations were ""harmful and humiliating'. Another group said they may amount to torture. The Indonesian military has defended the tests, saying they stop immoral women from entering the armed forces. Indonesia's police faced criticism last year for requiring the examinations. As well as HRW, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT) also spoke out about the practice ahead of a conference on military medicine in Bali, Indonesia. IRCT described the testing as ""a gross violation of women's rights and one that may amount to ill-treatment and torture under international law"". Both organisations also claimed that the fiancees of male officers were required to be examined before the marriage could go ahead, though the armed forces told AFP that this was not the case. 'Bad habit' A spokesman for Indonesia's military, Fuad Basya, told the BBC the test was ""still relevant"".

""If it is their habit, the Indonesian military cannot accept potential recruits like these,"" Mr Basya said. The World Health Organization regards virginity tests as a form of sexual violence. It also says the practice has no scientific validity. There are many reasons why a woman's hymen (a membrane which partially covers the vaginal opening) may not appear ""intact"" on examination.

Despite the savings, the Tory-led authority said it ""fully intends"" to ensure the bypass will be a dual-carriageway road. It now has until September to draw up a more detailed funding bid. The government will make a final decision on the scheme by the end of 2011.",Lincoln's stalled Eastern Bypass plans have moved forward after the county council reduced the cost of the scheme.
"The inquiry comes after bidder Live Nation said it had become the majority shareholder of the event in March. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is investigating whether the takeover would lead to a ""substantial lessening of competition"". It said it had asked Live Nation and the festival to operate separately until it had agreed any merger. Live Nation, which has refused to comment, moved to take up a controlling stake of the festival through LN-Gaiety - its UK joint venture with music mogul Denis Desmond's Gaiety Investments. Announcing the plan last month, Mr Desmond said it was ""fantastic"" to add it to its portfolio of more than 85 music festivals worldwide, including Reading, Leeds, Wireless and T in in the Park. Isle of Wight Festival founder John Giddings said the partnership would ""give us the ability to access the company's scale and talent pool, bringing more acts and a better experience to the UK"". Live Nation has been on a buying spree recently, making eight major acquisitions worldwide in 2016, while the Isle of Wight Festival deal marked its sixth so far this year. The CMA said it had not yet set a date for consultation submissions or its decision. In October, organisers threatened to cancel this June's event unless fee changes were agreed with Solo Promoters Ltd. But the following month, Sir Rod Stewart was revealed as the headliner. It is expected to attract about 42,000 fans, with other acts including DJ David Guetta, indie-pop group Bastille and singer-songwriter George Ezra announced. Mr Giddings revived the festival in 2002 after a 32-year hiatus. It first started in 1968, with guitarist Jimi Hendrix making a headline performance in 1970.",A takeover bid for the Isle of Wight Festival is being investigated by a watchdog amid concerns over the deal.

"The campaign in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin province mainly focuses on North Koreans fleeing poverty and persecution at home. China is known to routinely repatriate North Koreans who often slip across the border undetected. Human rights groups say many face punishment when they return. ""Foreigners who illegally enter, work and overstay are hidden troubles, and they might pose potential threats to social stability,"" Li Yongxue, a police official from Yanbian, was quoted by state-run China Daily newspaper as saying. The police say they want to stamp out criminal activities to maintain order. They add that those without proper documents will be sent back. Many of these illegal immigrants have relatives in China, some come to work, while others use China as a staging post before moving to other countries, according to the BBC's Michael Bristow.

"Officials in south-eastern Minas Gerais state say one person is confirmed dead. But there are reports that up to 16 have died and others are missing. Rivers of thick red mud surged down the valleys of the hilly area outside the old colonial city of Mariana. It engulfed cars and lorries, and destroyed homes. Authorities in Mariana said the dam had ruptured on Thursday afternoon and sent torrents of mud and debris into the small town of Bento Rodrigues, about 7km (four miles) away. The BBC's Julia Dias Carneiro in Rio de Janeiro said the area affected is home to about 500 people. The rescue operation has been hampered by fears of landslides but helicopters have taken several stranded people to safety, she adds. Authorities have warned that the water mixed with residue from mining operations could be toxic. A spokesman for the Samarco mining company, which owns the dam, said the cause of the breach was not yet known.","More than a dozen people are feared dead after a dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Brazil burst, flooding nearby homes."

"Blasts five minutes apart killed 21 people at two pubs on 21 November 1974. The code given with telephoned bomb warnings distinguished them from hoaxes, during the early 1970s. Ex-detective John Plimmer said it made no practical difference to individual officers' responses. The Irish Republican Army is believed to have carried out the bombings, but no-one has admitted responsibility. On the night the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs were bombed, the caller used the phrase ""Double X"", the inquests hearing heard. Frontline officers sent to both scenes told the jury they were never told the initial bomb warnings, called in at 8.11pm, had been accompanied with the code. Mr Plimmer, now in his seventies, said: ""It was very rare it was [passed down]. ""We usually found out that it was a coded warning after the event."" He added he did not think it made a difference, except for raising ""adrenaline"" levels. Although, he accepted there ""could have been a more rigid system"" of passing on the fact of coded warnings, when asked by Lesley Thomas QC, representing nine of the bereaved families. Ex-constable Rod Hazlewood, who recovered six dead bodies from the Mulberry Bush, said he ""would have expected"" to have been told about the coded warnings from his station controller. He added if he had been told about the coded warnings it ""would have directed you more appropriately"". The jury also heard, his sub-division was at ""half-strength"" that evening.

"Cumbria Police Authority has set its final budget, which involves savings of £18.7m over the next four years, describing it as ""unprecedented"" times. As well as the officer number cuts, which will be achieved through natural wastage, 235 staff posts are going. Authority chairman Ray Cole said it supported the force's programme of cuts and asked that frontline policing was not affected wherever possible. He said: ""The budget that we have agreed today is the first in a four-year transition period and it is forecast that 66% of the budget cuts required will be in the first two years. ""The constabulary faces some difficult challenges due to the scale of the budget cuts over a four-year period."" 'Response times' Cumbria Chief Constable Craig Mackey said it was a challenging time for the force. He said: ""It is a relatively small number of officers but I don't underestimate the impact that these reductions will have cumulatively in terms of visibility of officers. ""What we are working on is that we have got people available and we are still able to meet the demands that come in from the public."" But Andy Wilson, chair of Cumbria Police Federation, said he was concerned about the impact. ""There are going to be less police officers covering bigger areas,"" he said. ""In Cumbria's case we have a lot of rural villages and towns so those response times are going to be cut down.

"Marine FC will play Jose Mourinho's Premier League outfit in the third round of the contest on 10 January. But fans will be barred from the Merseyside stadium due to coronavirus restrictions. Chief executive officer James Leary said it was necessary but ""galling"". The game, at the Marine Travel Arena in Crosby, will be televised on BBC One. However, Liverpool's new tier three status means there will now be no crowd inside the 3,185-capacity stadium, costing the eighth-tier club not only gate receipts, but also around £70,000 in sponsorship deals. 'Heart-wrenching' Part-timers Marine have instead launched a virtual £10 match ticket raffle, which could raise around £30,000. The top prize is the chance to replace manager Neil Young in the dugout for a pre-season friendly. Leary said: ""Thirty thousand pounds to us is absolutely massive. ""It's about a quarter of the wage budget for a year. Even though £30,000 to a Football League club might not be a huge sum, it's a massive figure for us.""

"The conservation charity said ending overfishing and better marine protection measures would be a better approach. A pilot scheme to shoot seals is under consideration by the Irish government in counties Cork and Kerry. The charity said it was good news that seal numbers had increased. Pádraig Fogarty, from the Irish Wildlife Trust, told Irish broadcaster RTÉ that seals were one of the first protected species in Ireland. Reduced fish stocks were a result of an ""ecological collapse of the ocean ecosystem"", he said. RTÉ reported there has been speculation that the Department of Housing, Local government and Heritage had received five applications for licences to cull seals, including three which specified using high-powered rifles. Mr Fogarty said protected marine areas needed to be established around the Irish coast and urged the phasing out of bottom trawlers and super-trawlers.",A plan to cull seal numbers in Irish waters to improve fish stocks has been criticised by the Irish Wildlife Trust.
"Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where 200 more are needed, is asking existing staff to work extra shifts. The Royal College of Nursing said it would be dangerous for the health of staff and patients if up to three extra shifts had to be worked per week. The hospital said its campaign targeted experienced and newly qualified staff for all departments. A hospital spokeswoman said: ""Cambridge University Hospitals has launched a national recruitment campaign for nurses, midwives and healthcare assistants.

Karen Webb from the Royal College of Nursing said: ""I was not aware that we were entering an age of bartering to get employees to work. ""It is important that nurses, as professional people, are rewarded appropriately and adequately for their services to the NHS."" Steve Hand, director of operations at Addenbrooke's, said that the hospital needed about 200 extra staff to meet commitments to patients. The hospital was looking for experienced nurses and had turned to Europe to seek them out, he said. ""We will carry out English tests but I do not think language is going to be an issue,"" he said. Former NHS Trust chairman Roy Lilley said that many hospitals were setting up staff banks which were lists of people willing to do extra shifts.

There had also been about 1,000 job cuts in Cambridgeshire and this all added to the problem, he added.","A hospital in Cambridge is to recruit nurses, midwives and other staff from across Europe to meet ward shortages."
"The cause of death of Byun Hee-soo, a transgender rights campaigner, is not yet known. She launched a landmark legal challenge against the military in January last year over her dismissal. Her petition for reinstatement was rejected in July. South Korea remains conservative on matters relating to the LGBT community. The 23-year-old had been receiving counselling from a mental health centre near her home in Cheongju in Chungcheong province (which is south of Seoul). Her counsellor became concerned after not hearing from her since 28 February and called emergency services. Ms Byun's case triggered debate about the treatment of transgender troops and soldiers from the LGBTQ community in the country. She previously told reporters that apart from her gender identity, she wanted to show everyone that she could also be one of the great soldiers who protect the country. All able-bodied South Korean men are required to carry out military service for nearly two years. In December, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea said the decision not to allow her to continue to serve in the military had no legal grounds. South Korea is far less tolerant of the LGBTQ community than its East Asian neighbours. Being LGBT is often seen as a disability or a mental illness, or by powerful conservative churches as a sin, and there are no anti-discrimination laws in the country. In Ms Byun's case, anti-LGBT campaigners had attempted to identify her online. They also held demonstrations urging the military to dismiss her after news about the case emerged and have called for further demonstrations.","South Korea's first transgender soldier, who was discharged from the military for undergoing gender reassignment surgery, has been found dead at her home."
"Out of 57 sites, only the eight larger ""supersites"", which account for about 90% of material collected, will remain. Ten others will become glass only sites as jars and glass bottles are not collected through the kerbside scheme, which was introduced in March 2014. Recycling officer Tina Norman-Ross said it followed falling usage and the move should save £25,000 in its first year. She said that estimate did not include any money that would have been needed to be spent on maintenance, refurbishments and replacing bins. Mrs Norman-Ross said: ""The majority of sites we are closing or looking to convert are little used, and in a lot of cases little known. ""The amount collected from them has also fallen sharply, and in most cases there are alternative facilities nearby. Maintaining them all is no longer sensible financially.""

"PC Darren Bond is due to be sentenced on 21 September at Gloucester Crown Court after admitting eight offences relating to indecent images. A misconduct hearing for gross misconduct will be held in public at force headquarters on Tuesday. Bond, 46, was stationed at Kenneth Steele House in Bristol. The misconduct hearing will hear evidence that two phones were seized when his home was searched in November 2017. 'Wholly abhorrent' They contained 579 indecent images - some of the highest level of severity - and six movie files of children. On 10 August, Bond admitted distributing the images through online chat forums. Speaking after this court appearance, head of investigations Ch Supt Carolyn Belafonte said: ""This officer has pleaded guilty to wholly abhorrent offences and we utterly condemn his behaviour.

"Ford chief executive Mark Fields said it was ""going forward"" with its plan to shift production of small cars from its Michigan plant. However, he repeated assurances that no jobs would be lost due to the move. Mr Trump threatened during the election campaign to impose a tariff on car imports from firms like Ford. He said companies which moved jobs abroad would be charged ""a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States"". The president-elect also said he would build a wall with Mexico and renegotiate the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which includes Mexico. But the Ford boss said a levy on car imports would hurt the US economy.

""I continue to think that the right policies will prevail because we continue to share the same objective which is a healthy and vibrant US economy,"" he said. Ford has previously said it would shift production of its US-produced Focus and C-Max models to a new facility in Mexico by 2018.

"Foreign minister Maria Fernanda Espinosa said the UK was unwilling to take part in talks about his release. A UK Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Assange should ""leave the embassy to face justice"". Mr Assange, 46, has been staying at the country's London embassy since 2012 where he was granted political asylum. Last week, the arrest warrant against him was upheld meaning as soon as he leaves the embassy he will be detained. Ecuador's foreign minister said: ""On the issue of mediation, I have to say very honestly that it has not been successful because two parties are needed to mediate. Ecuador is willing, but not necessarily the other party"". She said her country would ""continue looking for mechanisms"" to end the stalemate. But a spokesman from the UK Foreign Office said: ""Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice"" Last December, Mr Assange was granted Ecuadorean citizenship in a move which the country hoped could give him immunity in the UK. But the UK does not recognise Mr Assange as a diplomatic agent and continues to insist he should ""face justice"". There is no extradition treaty between the UK and Ecuador so he cannot be arrested inside the embassy. Mr Assange breached bail conditions when he sought refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy six years ago. He faced questioning over sexual assault allegations in Sweden, which have since been dropped. Previously, Mr Assange has justified his decision to break bail conditions arguing if he faced the Swedish authorities he would be extradited to the US over the publication of classified documents.",Ecuador says the country's latest efforts to negotiate the departure of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from its London embassy have failed.

"Egyptian telecoms firm Orascom, which is a partner in Koryolink, estimates that more than 1 million North Koreans use mobile phones. They will not be able to use the new service, according to reports. Orascom launched a 3G phone network inside North Korea in 2008, but users can only use it to make phone calls. International calls, including calls to South Korea, are banned. In January 2013 the government began allowing foreign visitors to bring their own mobile devices into the country with them for the first time. Following a recent visit to the notoriously closed country, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt wrote in a blog post that North Korea's decision to isolate itself ""is very much going to affect their physical world and their economic growth."" He added that it would be ""very easy"" for 3G internet access to be enabled on the existing service.

"It predicted that prices would have to rise 1% between 2016 and 2020. That is on top of an increase of 5% it expects to have to make as a result of general wage inflation. The Living Wage means that the minimum wage will be set at £7.20 an hour for over-25s from April 2016, which is forecast to rise to £9.35 in 2020. The prediction came with Next's half year results - pre-tax profits came in at £347m, up 7% from the same period of 2014. Earlier in the year, the company's shares fell after it issued a cautious sales outlook, predicting they would grow between 1.5% and 5.5%. In the first half, total Next group sales were up 2.7% compared with the same period of 2014. Budget changes On Wednesday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) published some research into how far the National Living Wage (NLW) would offset the cuts in benefits and tax credits announced in the 2015 Budget. It found that families with someone in paid employment that are eligible for benefits or tax credits would lose an average of £750 a year as a result of the changes. The IFS estimates that this group of 8.4 million working-age households will gain an average of £200 a year from the NLW. It says this is an optimistic estimate because it assumes that the NLW will have no effect on GDP, employment or the number of hours worked. Those averages also mask the differences in effects on different income groups. The IFS estimated that households in lower income groups would lose more as a result of the tax credit and benefit changes but gain less as a result of the NLW.",The retailer Next has set out the effect it thinks the government's National Living Wage will have on its prices.

On Monday, an independent panel appointed by Toshiba said the firm had overstated its operating profit by a total of 151.8bn yen ($1.22bn, £780m). The overstatement was roughly triple an initial Toshiba estimate. The finance minister, Taro Aso, said the case could undermine confidence in corporate governance in Japan. The inquiry found that the misreporting of profits began after the financial crash seven years ago, when senior managers began imposing unrealistic performance targets. ""Within Toshiba, there was a corporate culture in which one could not go against the wishes of superiors,"" the report said. ""Therefore, when top management presented 'challenges', division presidents, line managers and employees below them continually carried out inappropriate accounting practices to meet targets in line with the wishes of their superiors.""",Toshiba's chief executive and president Hisao Tanaka is to resign after the company said it had overstated its profits for the past six years.

"The viruses were found on office computers and in a system used to model the movement of nuclear fuel rods. Power firm RWE said the infection posed no threat to the plant because its control systems were not linked to the internet, so the viruses could not activate. German federal cyber investigators are now analysing how the Gundremmingen plant became infected. No damage The viruses were found on the fuel rod modelling system and on 18 USB sticks used as removable data stores on office computers. Staff found the viruses as they prepared to upgrade the computerised control systems for the plant's Block B, which is currently not producing power while it undergoes scheduled maintenance. More than 1,000 computers have now been checked for infection and cleaned up, an RWE spokesman told newspaper Die Zeit. The plant has also improved its security controls. No system directly involved with the control of the nuclear reactors was infected, RWE said, and there was no danger to the public as a result of the infection. ""All sensitive plant areas are decoupled and designed with redundancy and protected against manipulation,"" added RWE in a statement. Among the viruses were two well-known malicious programs - W32.Ramnit and Conficker. Ramnit debuted in 2010 and is a remote access tool that its creators use to steal data. Conficker dates from 2008 and aims to grab login names and financial data. Because the infected systems were isolated from the net, neither Ramnit nor Conficker were able to activate, update and steal data, said RWE. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, said power plants and other chunks of a nation's critical infrastructure were often infected by viruses but such compromises did little damage. ""The most common viruses spread without much awareness of where they are,"" he told Reuters. Gundremmingen is about 120km (75m) northwest of Munich and the plant is Gemany's highest output power station.",Computer viruses have infected PCs used at a German nuclear power plant.
