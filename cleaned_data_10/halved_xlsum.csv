0,"Defence Estates, which runs about 2,400 hectares for the MoD, is being replaced by the new Defence Infrastructure Organisation. The MoD said changes would save £1.2bn over the first four years. The Unite union said the decision was ""absolute madness,"" and urged the government to change its mind. Plans to axe 25,000 civilian MoD jobs were outlined in last year's strategic defence review. The department says it will consult with trade unions over the changes, which it says will ""bring together those working on estate and infrastructure activity across the Ministry of Defence"". It says it will bring together 7,000 staff - mostly civilians - working on construction, maintenance and disposal of land and buildings owned by the MoD. Most of them currently work for Defence Estates, although some work in infrastructure jobs in the RAF, Army and Royal Navy or smaller organisations. 'Devastating news' Defence Secretary Liam Fox said having one organisation running the estate would provide ""better strategic management"" and save money in running costs. ""By making these changes we expect to save about 2,500 posts by 2014 and some £1.2 billion over the first four years alone, without reducing the effectiveness or reliability of the service we deliver. ""This measure will make a significant contribution to the civilian staff reductions and efficiency measures set out last October in the Strategic Defence and Security Review."" He said it was the first change stemming from work by the defence reform unit which aims to overhaul the structure of the MoD. Unite national officer Kevin Coyne said: ""This is devastating for our members. It's absolute madness, the Tories spent the 80s decentralising the MoD and now they're centralising it with Stalinist fervour. ""With 2,500 fewer staff, the maintenance and running of MoD properties and land will be run on a shoestring doing our forces and their families a disservice. We urge the government to step back from this decision.""","About 2,500 Ministry of Defence jobs will go within three years, as the department changes the way it manages its land and buildings."
1,"By Danny ShawHome affairs correspondent Joseph McCann, 34, is alleged to have abducted and raped three women in north London and Watford last week. He was not - but should have been - referred to the Parole Board before he was released from prison in February, while halfway through serving a sentence for burglary. The Ministry of Justice said an ""urgent review"" of the case was under way. McCann was jailed in 2008 for aggravated burglary after admitting breaking into the home of an 85-year-old man. He was given an Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection (IPP) with a minimum term, or tariff, of two-and-a-half years. This meant the Parole Board had to decide if it was safe to release him once his tariff expired in 2010. In 2017 he was released on licence, which meant he could be sent back to jail if he reoffended or breached his parole conditions. Later that year, while on licence, McCann was arrested and charged with a further burglary. He was given a three-year jail sentence. McCann's case should have been referred to the board before he was released but in February this year he was dealt with as a ""determinate sentence"" prisoner. This meant he was automatically released 18 months into his sentence. A £20,000 reward has been offered by the Metropolitan Police for information about McCann's whereabouts that leads to his arrest and prosecution. Detectives described McCann as ""extremely dangerous"" and said people should call 999 if they saw him. He is described as white, with a muscular build, a bald head or shaved blond hair, a light-coloured short beard, and the name ""Bobbie"" tattooed on his stomach.

This might seem like an unusual personal ad, but one lonely goose in Moira is apparently heartbroken after her companion tragically died. Now an appeal has been made to find her a new man - or gander to be precise. Barbara Mladek is the founder of Northern Ireland Battery Hen Rescue and is trying to find a ""more mature"" gander. ""A friend of mine had a pair of geese for a long number of years. ""Unfortunately the gander died on Thursday night and the 21-year-old goose is really distressed pining for her mate,"" she said. Ms Mladek explained that geese mate for life, but if one dies, they can match again if another goose comes along quickly enough. ""As soon as you introduce them one-on-one, the gander immediately protects the goose, they share a bucket of water, and do a head dipping ritual that says 'yeah, you're mine now.' ""It's a lovely thing to watch."" She set up Northern Ireland Battery Hen Rescue six years ago and is optimistic she will find a match for the goose. ""I've found a gander before for someone who was looking for a mate for her goose. ""There are a lot of people in Northern Ireland who do have a flock of geese; maybe they have too many ganders, or maybe an older gander has lost his mate."" If you have a gander that might fit the bill you can get in touch with Barbara via the Northern Ireland Hen Rescue facebook page.",21-year-old bird seeks new man for companionship and possibly more.
3,"Everton Nurseries near Lymington, Hampshire displayed a sign urging customers to ""please stock up"" on metaldehyde pellets. Friends of the Earth said it was ""irresponsible"" to encourage use of the chemical which is to be banned over concerns about its effects on wildlife. The store later apologised, saying it was ""completely wrong"". Last year the government announced sales of Metaldehyde, a pesticide used to control slugs in a range of crops and in gardens, are to be banned in June. The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it posed an ""unacceptable risk to birds and mammals"". The garden centre placed a sign alongside its stock of metaldehyde slug pellets saying: ""Sadly, the most effective slug killer, metaldehyde, will no longer be available for sale"", before encouraging customers to stock up and use the product during the period of 12 months when its use remains legal. New Forest Friends of the Earth tweeted a picture of the sign which it described as ""outrageous"". It said the chemical was ""responsible for deaths right up the food chain - hedgehogs and birds for example"". The Flower Power Lymo community allotment group in Lymington tweeted: ""Please help STOP this. Encouraging the use of metaldehyde slug pellets is wrong. They're banned for a reason."" In a statement, Everton Nurseries director Simon Collyer said it was an ""ill-advised attempt to promote sales"" by a junior member of staff. ""We agree that it was completely wrong to promote the sale of product shortly to be made illegal. ""All units of the product and associated signage have been removed from the shelves and Everton Nurseries will no longer offer it for sale,"" he added.",A garden centre has been criticised for promoting soon-to-be-banned slug pellets.
4,"Visitors have complained about hour-long waits outside at Leicester Royal Infirmary leading to missed appointments. Officials have admitted there are serious problems at peak times. Both the hospital and city council insisted they were looking at solutions including new car parks but funding issues remained. One way Officials admitted the 400-space Havelock Street car park could not cope with demand, especially since a nearby private car park had temporarily closed. Nigel Bond, head of facilities at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, said land near the Leicester Tigers' stadium had planning permission for a multi-storey car park. ""We are still very interested in that but the challenge around that is the financing and it has to be the right deal for all parties involved and it has to meet everyone's needs. ""We are also consulting with private car park providers and we are developing the building strategy for the royal infirmary site and we are very conscious for the need for public parking on the site."" Patrick Kitterick, chairman of the planning committee at Leicester City Council, admitted that until a new car park was built, they were ""tinkering at the edges"". ""There is a lot of conflict when Jarrom Street meets Havelock Street. So we are looking at playing about with a one-way system there. ""But it is not going to solve the big problem which is the car park is heavily used at specific times and the access and exits to it are very difficult.""",Bosses at a Leicester hospital have said they are looking at solutions to long parking queues.
5,"The far-right leader, who takes office on 1 January, had questioned the doctors' qualifications. He also accused Cuba's communist government of keeping 75% of their pay, and refusing to let their families join them. The pull-out could disrupt healthcare for millions of Brazilians. Why were so many Cuban doctors in Brazil? Healthcare is Cuba's most lucrative export. The ""More Doctors"" aid programme operates in 67 countries, and makes the island $11bn a year. Around 8,000 Cuban doctors have been working in Brazil's poorest and remotest areas under the scheme. Cuba has said they will all be summoned home by the end of December. However, a Brazilian diplomatic source told AFP that 2,000 will likely stay put due to personal ties. Brazilian mayors have warned that up to 30 million people are facing a care crisis - many in areas where local doctors refuse to go. The first 196 doctors to leave have already been greeted in Havana by Cuba's deputy health minister. Cuban news agency ACN said the medics were ""happy to have fulfilled their mission,"" but ""worried about what awaits the [Brazilian] people with the newly-elected president"". Brazil's health ministry said on Friday that it would start selecting local doctors to replace the departing Cubans later this month.","Cuba is pulling thousands of doctors out of Brazil, after what it called ""contemptuous and threatening"" remarks by president-elect Jair Bolsonaro."
6,"Residents of Moseley Green, near Parkend, say the animals regularly ruin grass verges by foraging for food. The Forestry Commission acknowledged there could be more of the animals than a recent survey suggested. A cull by the commission began last month in an attempt to keep numbers down to 400 as part of a three-year management plan. Locals claim estimates of 535 for the boar population was inaccurate and far more than the target of 135 animals need to be killed to reach that figure. Martin Roach, landlord of The Rising Sun pub, said he had spent thousands of pounds making the pub an ""attractive venue"" but the wild boars were causing damage. ""I've got damage all up the driveway,"" he said. ""We all like the countryside, we all like the forest, we all like the boar, but in their place. ""It's got too much. We've got too many of them."" 'Viable population' Resident Clive Skinner said: ""A couple of months ago I was able to repair the damage on a daily basis. ""We're at the stage now that it's major, major work to do the repairs."" Earlier this year the Forestry Commission said a living population of 400 wild boar in the area had been agreed. It said there was an estimated population of 535 animals, meaning 135 would have to be culled before next February. Kevin Stannard from the commission said: ""That figure is a minimum. We still think there are over 700 or 800 animals in the forest. ""If we can bring that level back down to 400 that should be a good compromise for the animal welfare groups to see that we've got a sound, viable population. ""But also for those who visit and use the forest to show we are managing the population and keeping it under control at a level that everyone can live with.""",People living in a hamlet in the Forest of Dean have claimed not enough wild boar are being culled.
7,"Sergio Cabral served two terms as Rio state governor from 2007 to 2014. He was accused of received kickbacks from construction firms in return for awarding them lucrative contracts, such as a petrochemical plant in Rio. Judge Sergio Moro said there was not enough evidence to convict Cabral's wife Adriana Ancelmo. Cabral was detained in November as part of Operation Car Wash, a huge corruption investigation which has resulted in the arrest of a long list of high-ranking politicians and influential business people in Brazil. Cabral is a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party of President Michel Temer, who is also under investigation for alleged corruption. Judge Moro said the former governor had taken 2.7m reais ($813,000; £638,000) in bribes. The judge said the money had not yet been found and that he suspected Cabral had transferred it before his accounts were blocked. The former interior minister for Rio state, Wilson Carlos Carvalho, was also found guilty of corruption and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was Cabral's right-hand man while he was in office.",The former governor of Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state has been sentenced to 14 years and two months in prison for corruption and money laundering.
8,"By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor The data measures the percentage of working-age adults who are employed. In the period March to May 2019, the rate increased by 1.7 percentage points compared to the same period in 2018. During the recession, the employment rate reached a low of 64%. Despite the latest increase, Northern Ireland's employment rate is still below the average UK rate of 76%. Economic inactivity in Northern Ireland also decreased over the quarter and the year to one of the lowest rates on record - 25.9%. It is a measurement of those people who are not in work and not looking for work - that includes students, retired people and sick or disabled people. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) said the falling inactivity rate since 2017 suggests that some people have been re-entering the labour market. ""Decreases in economic inactivity since late 2017 indicate that changes in labour market status have not been limited to those working or looking for work, but also for those who were previously outside the labour force,"" its statement said. Meanwhile wage growth in the UK rose to 3.6% in the year to May 2019, the highest growth rate since 2008, according to Office for National Statistics figures. However, adjusting for inflation, wages held steady compared with last month. There is no specific monthly data on wages for Northern Ireland.",Northern Ireland's employment rate has risen to a record high of 71.7%.
